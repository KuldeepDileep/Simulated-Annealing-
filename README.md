# Simulated Annealing 

Implement Simulated Annealing algorithm to find global maximum/minimum of any function. You are required to give visibility of execution of your SA algorithm by plotting graphs of x,y and f. You can use matplotlib library in python to plot these graphs. The following functions will be used as examples:

The range of x and y can be seen in plots below. Make sure that you are handling boundary values appropriately.
